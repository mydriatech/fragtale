//! Atomic average calculation.

use std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64;
use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;

/** Atomic average calculations tailored for metrics.

[Self] uses a single [AtomicU64] where the most significant bits are
used to track the number of items.

```text
63-40   (24 bits)   Number of items.    2^24 â‰ƒ > 15 M items
39- 0   (40 bits)   Sum of all items.   2^40 = > 10^12
```

The averaged values needs to be below `2^40 / 2^24 = 65_536`.

Intended use-case:

* Get average of duration in range 0-60_000 milliseconds.
* 1M ops/s and [AtomicMetricAverage] is scraped every 15 seconds.
* OR 0.25M ops/s and [AtomicMetricAverage] is scraped every 60 seconds.
